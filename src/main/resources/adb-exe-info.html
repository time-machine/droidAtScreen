<p>
  In order to establish a connection to a device, this application uses the<br/>
  Android Debug Bridge (ADB). If ADB is not running when this program launches,<br/>
  it will start ADB. However, for this to work, it needs the full path to the ADB <br/>
  executable.
</p>
<p>
  You can find the ADB executable in the Android SDK installation directory, under <br/>
  <code>/platform-tools</code>. If you have either of the environment variables <br/>
  ANDROID_HOME or ANDROID_SDK_HOME defined and pointing to the SDK installation dir, <br/>
  it will pick it up from there, without you having to specify the path.
</p>
<p>
  Please, provide the full path to the ADB executable below.
